# CSE-360-Final-Project
Color-Motion Robot code for final project.

The basis of our robotics project is going to be a simulation of a robot that moves based on the color they see in front of them. We plan to implement three different color movements, red, yellow, and green. For the color red, the robot will stop motion. For the color yellow, the robot will move at a constant speed slower than that for the green. For the color green, the robot will start motion at a faster speed than that for the yellow. This is meant to show how a robot would react in front of a stop light.
